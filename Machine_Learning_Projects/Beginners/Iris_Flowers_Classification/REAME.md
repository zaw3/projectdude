### Iris-Flowers-Classification-ML-Project

Iris flowers classification is one of the 'Hello World' machine learning projects.

This project is to classify flowers into serveral categories based on the features given in the dataset.

* The dataset can be obtained from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris]

* I have used two ML algorithm in this projects

  (i) Support Vector machine

  (ii) Decision Trees

* The accuracy in both algorithm was higher as we expect.
* After training , our model can predict the categor of flowers
